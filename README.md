# socketProgramming
Program to demonstrate Client server interactions.

### Instructions on compiling and running the program.
IDE Used: Eclipse
Whole project should be imported on to the eclipse by the import project function. 
we start the program by running the serverGUI.java. start the server with any port number. empty port numbers will not start the server
we then run the ClientGUI.java file and connect to the server with the same port number.
we repeat this process until we have sufficient number of clients. GUI is pretty easy to understand and use.

we select broadcast in the clientlist dropdown to send a broadcast message to all connected clients. 
If we select a specific client on the dropdown list, the message will go to the selected user.
